# Stay-Away-Monster-
**Task
You are creating a video game and need to tell how far monsters are away from the player. This way the program knows if the player is close enough to attack a monster, or if the player gets too close to a monster that auto attacks. There are two ways to calculate the distance between the player and the monster: manhattan distance and euclidean distance. You want to know which is more accurate for the game. Write a program that computes the distance between the player and monster, then outputs the results. **
